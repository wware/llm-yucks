When implementing a retrieval-augmented generation system using Docker Compose, there are several components you need to consider: the vector database, the LLM (Large Language Model) running on Ollama, and possibly other services to handle data ingestion, querying, or supporting microservices.

### Choice of Vector Database
For the vector database, popular choices include:
1. **Pinecone** - A fully managed vector database service.
2. **Faiss** by Facebook - An efficient library for similarity search.
3. **Milvus** - An open-source vector database built for scalable similarity search.
4. **Weaviate** - An open-source vector search engine with good support for various data types.

For a Docker Compose setup, Milvus and Weaviate are solid choices as they are open-source and provide Docker images for easy deployment.

### Setup using Docker Compose
Here’s a conceptual approach to setting up your environment:

1. **Define Docker Compose Services**: Define services for the LLM running on Ollama, the vector database (let's use Milvus for this example), and other required services.

2. **Configure Milvus**: Use the official Milvus Docker images and configure the database according to your requirements. 

3. **Integrate LLM with Vector DB**: Implement a service that uses the vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings, and interacts with the LLM to provide retrieval-augmented responses.

### Example Docker Compose File
Here's a simplified example of a Docker Compose file that sets up Milvus and a mock LLM service:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  milvus:
    image: milvusdb/milvus:latest
    ports:
      - "19530:19530"
    volumes:
      - milvus_data:/var/lib/milvus
    environment:
      - TZ=UTC

  llm-service:
    image: ollama/llm:latest # Replace with the actual image name for your LLM service on Ollama
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - URL=http://milvus:19530   # URL for the vector DB service

  data-ingestion:
    build: ./data-ingestion
    depends_on:
      - milvus

volumes:
  milvus_data:
```

### Data Ingestion Service
You'll need a service to preprocess and ingest your Python source code into the vector database. This might involve:

1. Parsing Python source code.
2. Generating embeddings (using a model like Sentence Transformers).
3. Storing these embeddings in Milvus.

### Ingestion Service Code Example (Python)
Create a directory `data-ingestion` with a Dockerfile and a script `ingest.py`:

**Dockerfile:**
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "ingest.py"]
```

**requirements.txt:**
```txt
pymilvus
sentence-transformers
```

**ingest.py:**
```python
from pymilvus import connections, Collection
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import os

# Connect to Milvus
connections.connect(host='milvus', port='19530')

# Create a Milvus collection (if it doesn’t exist)
collection_name = 'code_embeddings'
dim = 768
collection = Collection(name=collection_name, schema=[...], auto_id=True)

# Load Sentence Transformer model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

def embed_and_store(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        code = f.read()
    embedding = model.encode(code)
    collection.insert([[embedding]])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Iterate over Python source files and ingest them
    source_dir = '/path/to/source/code'
    for root, _, files in os.walk(source_dir):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                embed_and_store(os.path.join(root, file))
```

### Example GitHub Projects
For comprehensive examples, you might want to look at these projects:
- **Milvus Bootcamp GitHub**: https://github.com/milvus-io/bootcamp - Contains examples for setting up and using Milvus with various data types.
- **Weaviate Examples**: https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-python-client - Demonstrates how to use Weaviate with Python.

### Final Steps
- Adapt the ingestion service and the LLM service to interact properly using the Milvus vectors.
- Implement the retrieval-augmented generation logic in the LLM service, where it retrieves relevant embeddings from Milvus and uses them to generate more contextual responses.

This setup provides a strong foundation for your retrieval-augmented generation system, scalable and manageable with Docker Compose.
